# Synthux Simple Touch Plugdata
 A place to store and share my Plugdata patches.
 
 Mainly setup for now as a place to gather and bring structure to my various attempts at building a droning patch. That are spread out across too many different folders and two computers ... 
 
 In time I will share these with ready to upload .bin files. And hopefully some documentation etc.

 Some examples of using these drones I've already shared on Youtube and Instagram. find me @jonwtr
