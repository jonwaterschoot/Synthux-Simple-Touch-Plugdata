# Synthux Simple Touch Plugdata
 A place to store and share my Plugdata patches. Most are made for Simple Touch or Simple Fix

Most useful / finished ones are: 

## Custom JSON

[Board definition / setup](/Custom-JSON/) - These are a few of the JSON's I use for my devices, I've modded some with added CV and LED's, hence there are a few versions.


## Hardware: 

[Hardware Test Patches](/HW_test-patches/) - testing components connected to Daisy Seed, made with Plugdata.

## FX & Instruments:

[FM_BleepBloop](/FX-Instruments/FM_bleepbloop_touch/) - a sequence-able weird sound generator using Frequency Modulation. (for Simple Touch)

[Selfdistort Touch](/FX-Instruments/selfdistort_touch/) - a distortion effect for audio in that can self-oscillate. (for Simple Touch)

[Frequencyshift Touch](/FX-Instruments/frequencyshift-touch/) - Two patches playing with frequency shifting. (for Simple Touch)

## Unfinished / Dump
[Dump](/unfinished/) - Mainly setup for now as a place to gather and bring structure to my various attempts at building patches. They are spread out across too many different folders and ~~two~~ three computers ... 
 
 In time I will share these with ready to upload .bin files. And link them to the community. I'm also attempting to make some instructions / documentation for each.

 Some examples of using these drones and FX I've already shared on Youtube and Instagram.
